# YAAV simulator

Yet Another Autonomous Vehicle simulator. Started the development in 2009 (lecacy code C++03), but is still under construction!
Not based on any external 3D game engine.

Challenge: refactor legacy code to Modern C++ and use [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).
